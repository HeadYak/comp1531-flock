user = {
            'u_id': int,
            'name_first': string,
            'name_last': name_last,
            'handle_str': string,
            'email': string,
            'password': string
            'token': number
        }

```

* channels - channels is a list of dictionaries with each dictionary having the following keys

```python

              'is_public': boolean
              'creator': dictionary,

* Creator, owners, and members are represented by dictionaries in this form

```python
